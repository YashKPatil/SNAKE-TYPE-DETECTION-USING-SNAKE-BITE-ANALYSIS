# SNAKE-TYPE-DETECTION-USING-SNAKE-BITE-ANALYSIS

Overview
This project is an AI-powered system designed to classify snake toxicity by analyzing snake bite images. It determines whether a snake is venomous or non-venomous based on the bite pattern. The system utilizes deep learning techniques with TensorFlow, OpenCV, and transfer learning for accurate image classification.

Technologies Used:                    
  
     Python: Main programming language   
   
     TensorFlow 2.x: For building and training the image classification model
   
     OpenCV: For image preprocessing and manipulation
   
     Transfer Learning: Using pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNetV2, ResNet) to fine-tune the model for better accuracy
   
     Teachable Machine (optional): For initial model training

Requirements
      
    Python 3.x
  
    TensorFlow 2.x
  
    OpenCV
  
    NumPy
  
    Matplotlib (for visualizations)
